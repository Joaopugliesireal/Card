# Card
Here i'm trying to expand my knowledge by learning ReactDOM... making my code a little more organized.
Making the course "React course", provided by FreeCodeCamp. Now i can see the real benefits of learning a library (Ps. Yeah, i know that in this example i'm not using the ideal way of making value by React, however, i'll soon.)
